# Position-based fluids in OpenCL
Course assignment for CS 348C: Animation and Simulation, Fall 2016. Based on the paper [Position-Based Fluids](http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf) by Macklin and MÃ¼eller.

The code is built using the `cl-gl-bootstrap` template for C++ project with OpenCL-OpenGL interoperability, written by me.

Note, do NOT use `git submodule update --recursive --remote`, it will mess up nanogui's GLFW version.
